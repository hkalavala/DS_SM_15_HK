    "Answer: Understand what's the difference between using Logit and OLS models. Both models seem to be from the statsmodel package. Explore if other data sources can add value to this analysis.   Understand what type of plots are available to plot and analyze the results of a logistic regression. From the above results from the model developed using the provided data set , it appears that the gre and gpa only matter when the student attended a rank 4 college. If they attended a rank 1,2,3 college it doesn't seem to matter. Is that a reasonable conclusion? It seems like we might want to explore additional data to confirm if that hyposthesis is true."
